## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (as specified in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Git** for version control
- **UV** (recommended) or pip/venv for dependency management

### Key Reading

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:

- [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md) – Comprehensive design overview
- [README.md](README.md) – Project purpose
- [usage.md](docs/usage.md) – Usage instructions
- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) – Project metadata and dependencies

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nuxview/Project-Tree.git
cd Project-Tree
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Using **UV** (recommended):

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Using **venv**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
# Or with pip:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs:

- `projtree` itself (editable)
- `watchdog>=5.0.0` (core dependency)
- `pytest` (for testing)
- `ruff` (for linting and formatting)

`uv sync` uses the checked-in `uv.lock`; the pip alternative resolves dependencies directly.

### 4. Verify Installation

Run the checks in CI order to confirm everything is set up correctly:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest -v
```

## Code Standards

### Structure and Organization

Project Tree follows a **separation of concerns** principle across four layers:

| Layer | Module | Responsibility |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| **CLI** | `cli.py` | Argument parsing and orchestration |
| **Generation** | `generator.py` | Read-only, deterministic tree generation |
| **Ignore System** | `ignore.py` | Ignore rule resolution |
| **Watcher** | `watcher.py` | Optional filesystem monitoring |

When adding features, place code in the appropriate module.

### Python Style

- **Language Version**: Python 3.10+ features are acceptable (e.g., type unions with `|`, match statements)
- **Type Hints**: All functions must include type hints for parameters and return values
  - Prefer modern syntax: `set[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `str | None` (3.10+)
- **Docstrings**: Use docstrings for all public functions and classes:

  ```python
  def load_ignore_file(root: Path) -> set[str]:
      """
      Load ignore entries from a .projtreeignore file in the root directory.

      :param root: Root directory containing .projtreeignore
      :return: Set of ignore rules
      """
   ```

- **Line Length**: Keep lines reasonably sized; aim for readability
- **Imports**:
  - Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
  - Avoid wildcard imports (`from x import *`)
  - Use `from pathlib import Path` for filesystem operations (not `os`)
  - Prefer modern syntax; avoid `typing` module imports when using Python 3.10+ built-in generics

### Naming Conventions

- Functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- Private members: prefix with `_` (e.g., `_internal_helper()`)
- Test functions: `test_<what_is_being_tested>` (e.g., `test_single_file`)

### Example Function Structure

```python
from pathlib import Path


def parse_ignore(value: str) -> set[str]:
    """Parse comma-separated ignore rules into a set."""
    return {item.strip() for item in value.split(",") if item.strip()}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Core Principle: Full-Output Assertion

All tests validating tree generation **must assert the complete output**, not fragments:

```python
# GOOD: Assert complete output
expected = (
    "# Project Structure\n\n"
    "## Generated by projtree\n\n"
    "```text\n"
    ".\n"
    "└── src\n"
    "    └── main.py\n"
    "```\n"
)
assert result == expected

# AVOID: Partial assertions
assert "main.py" in result  # Not enough; can miss formatting errors
```

This practice ensures:

- Ordering remains deterministic
- Formatting regressions are immediately visible
- No unintended content creeps into output

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_basic_tree.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage (if installed)
pytest --cov=projtree
```

### Test Organization

- **`test_basic_tree.py`** – Pure generation logic (determinism, output format, ignore behavior)
- **`test_cli.py`** – CLI argument parsing and orchestration
- **`test_watcher_basic.py`** – Event-handler regression tests and one live watcher smoke test
- **`test_internal_docs.py`** – Module, function, and test-helper docstring checks
- **`utils.py`** – Shared test helpers (e.g., `touch()` for file creation)

### Writing Tests

Use `tmp_path` fixture from pytest for isolated temporary directories:

```python
def test_single_file(tmp_path: Path):
    # Create test structure
    (tmp_path / "README.md").write_text("", encoding="utf-8")

    # Run generator
    result = generate_markdown_tree(tmp_path)

    # Assert complete output
    expected = (
        "# Project Structure\n\n"
        "## Generated by projtree\n\n"
        "```text\n"
        ".\n"
        "└── README.md\n"
        "```\n"
    )
    assert result == expected
```

### Test Philosophy

- **Rendering tests call the generator directly**; CLI tests cover ignore behavior and argument handling
- **Side effects are tested minimally** (watcher, filesystem I/O)
- **No mocks for deterministic functions** – call them directly
- **Avoid flaky timing-dependent tests** – use deterministic assertions

#### Note on Ignore System Testing

When testing ignore behavior, remember that ignore rules match against any **path component (segment)** of the relative path (operates only on names):

- Ignoring `"src"` prevents traversal of any directory or file named `src` at any depth
- This applies uniformly across nested levels (top-level `src/` and nested paths containing `src`)
- See [architecture.md Section 6.4](docs/architecture.md#64-matching-rules) for detailed matching rules

## Making Changes

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code standards outlined above
   - Keep commits atomic and descriptive
   - Update tests alongside implementation

3. **Test thoroughly**

   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```

4. **Update documentation**
   - If behavior changes, update [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
   - If CLI changes, update help text and [README.md](README.md)
   - Add docstrings to new functions

5. **Commit with clear messages**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: preserve CLI ignores in watch mode"
   git commit -m "test: cover watch ignore forwarding"
   ```

### Types of Changes

#### Bug Fixes

- Include a test that reproduces the bug
- Fix the issue
- Ensure the test now passes
- Update [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) if behavior changes

#### New Features

- Ensure the feature aligns with Project Tree's **minimalist philosophy** (see [Design Principles](#design-principles))
- Add comprehensive tests with full-output assertions
- Update [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) with design details
- Update [README.md](README.md) with usage examples

#### Documentation

- Fix typos and clarify language
- Ensure links are valid
- Keep architecture docs in sync with code

### Backwards Compatibility

Project Tree is currently in v1.x. Maintain backwards compatibility with:

- Existing CLI interface (no breaking changes to arguments)
- Output format (changes require semver bump)
- `.projtreeignore` file format

Breaking changes require explicit discussion and semver versioning.

---

## Design Principles

Project Tree v1 prioritizes:

### 1. **Correctness Over Features**

- Stable, predictable output takes precedence
- Deferred features are listed in [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#10-deferred-features)
- When unsure, omit rather than add complexity

### 2. **Simplicity Over Abstraction**

- Code should be readable in isolation
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Each function should have a single, clear responsibility

### 3. **Explicit Behavior Over Cleverness**

- No implicit magic or hidden defaults
- Clear documentation for edge cases
- Explicit ordering and formatting rules (including the equal-`casefold()` ordering limit in `docs/architecture.md`)

### 4. **Testability**

- Read-only generation tested against controlled filesystem fixtures
- No mocking required for core logic
- Tests serve as live documentation

### 5. **Separation of Concerns**

Adhere to the **four-layer architecture**:

- **CLI** handles only argument parsing, ignore aggregation, and orchestration
- **Generator** handles only tree generation (read-only, deterministic path traversal and ignore filtering)
- **Ignore** handles only ignore rule resolution and matching logic
- **Watcher** handles only filesystem monitoring and regeneration triggering

Code that spans layers should be refactored.

#### Important: Output File Handling

The output file (default `structure.md`) is handled at the **orchestration layer**, not in the generator:

- **CLI**: Resolves the scan root, builds ignores, and writes the returned Markdown; relative output paths use the working directory, not the scan root
- **Watcher**: Independently builds ignores and writes output; both orchestration paths add the output basename to ignores only when output is under the scan root
- **Generator**: Receives the scan root and ignore set, reads the tree, and returns Markdown without knowing the output path

The observer still watches recursively; output events are filtered by the handler. Keeping writes outside the generator makes rendering directly testable.

### 6. **Platform Independence**

- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem operations (not `os`)
- Test behavior on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Avoid platform-specific hacks
