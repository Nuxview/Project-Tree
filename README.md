Project Tree is a small, deterministic utility that generates a Markdown representation of a project’s directory structure.

---

## Features

* Generates a **deterministic Markdown project tree**
* Uses a **simple, explicit ignore system** based on exact name matching
* Optional **watch mode** for continuous regeneration
* **Minimal, testable design**

---

## Installation

Simply run:

```bash
pipx install project-tree
```

Or if you already have `UV` installed, simply run:

```bash
uv tool install project-tree
```

---

## Getting Started

Run `projtree` from your project root to generate `structure.md`.

```bash
projtree
```

## Usage

Run `projtree` with `--help` to see the full command reference, options, and example output.

```bash
projtree --help
```

Or see the [usage documentation](docs/usage.md) for the full command reference, options, and example output.

## Ignore System

* Built-in defaults include common directory and file names (e.g. `.git`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`)
* A `.projtreeignore` file in the project root is supported
* For normal runs, CLI `--ignore` arguments are merged with project and built-in ignores
* In `--watch` mode, CLI `--ignore` values are also forwarded, so watching uses built-in defaults, `.projtreeignore`, and any CLI-supplied ignores
* Ignore rules match **exact names anywhere in the tree** (e.g., `src` ignores any file/dir named `src` at any depth)
* Ignore entries are treated as exact names, not paths. For example, `target` works, but `src/target` does not match nested paths
* No globbing, wildcards, or pattern-based matching in v1
* If the output file is under the project root, its file name is also added to the ignore set to prevent regeneration loops

Example `.projtreeignore`:

```text
.venv
__pycache__
build
dist
```

## Running Tests

If you installed development dependencies:

```bash
pytest
```

All generator tests assert against **full output** to enforce deterministic structure.
Watcher tests are intentionally minimal and validate regeneration behavior only.
